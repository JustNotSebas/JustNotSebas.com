      <h4>About me? Alright, as you like.</h4>
      <p>I'm a 15 year old Colombian, born on November 5th, 2008. I don't really have anything really interesting to say about my life itself, because I don't have an interesting backstory, lmao.</p>
      <p>I'm dedicating to learning programming. I have a basic understandment of Python and I'm starting with HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
      <p>I'm also fascinated with videogames; My favorites are Minecraft, Celeste, and UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE.</p>
      <p>As myself, I don't really have that much patience. But I don't bite... sometimes.</p>
      <p>And yes. I'm in a relationship. â™¥</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>If you want to be friends, we can! Check my social media whenever you want!</p>
      <p>Hope to see ya' around!</p>
